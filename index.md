Tons of NGS data and other data have being generated in maize community. But not all of them have been extensively studied.
We believe published data can be repurposed for answering different questions.
Public data curated by domain experts (better to be the data generators) is critical for their re-usage.
From our past research experience, we learned that data tweaking and hammering is a tedious work. The smart maize researchers should spend their precious time on developing and testing hypothesis rather than processing, formatting, and reformatting theirs or others' raw data.

With this platform, we are trying to bring `published data`, `data producers`, and version controlled `pipelines` together.
But we are not intend to replace current database systems. Neither do we want to host or quality check the published data.  

The major purposes of this platform are:  

1. *Pointing the existing data sets.*   
2. *Providing reproducible data processing pipelines.*   
3. *Learning, discussing, and improving data analyzing practices.*


### How does it work?

First of all, this platform (or website) is open accessed on github as [ZeaBigData](https://github.com/ZeaBigData).




We are currently supported by maize researchers from:  
- [X lab](),  
- [Y lab](),  
- and [Z lab]().  


### How to contribute?

You can contribute by providing:

1. links to raw data or re-processed versions.  
2. data summary statistics.  
3. data analyses pipelines.  

```

###   
Git clone
