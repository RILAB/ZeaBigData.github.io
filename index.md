### Why we do this:

Tons of data have being generated. But not all of them have been extensively studied.
We believe published data can be repurposed for answering different questions, unless 1) we know the data well, 2) they have been probably processed, and 3) they are in a handy format.

Here, we are not intend to replace `NCBI`, `iPlant`, `maizeGDB`, or even `Panzea`. We do not responsible for hosting and generating data.

This light platform is trying to:

1. Point to you the exiting data sets.  
2. Provide clean data sets in various user friendly formats.  
3. Provide reproducible data processing pipelines.   
4. Teach, learn and discuss about data analyzing practices.


### Who we are?

We are maize researchers from [X lab](), [Y lab](), [Z lab]().
